# Knight Game

Knight Game is a simple Java application that simulates a two-player game where each player controls a knight on an 8x8 chess-like board. The game can be played either through a console interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX.

## Features

- **Console Gameplay**: Allows players to take turns moving their knights on the board through a text-based interface.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Provides a visual representation of the game board using JavaFX, allowing players to interact with the game through mouse clicks.
- **Knight Movement**: Knights can move according to the rules of chess. They have access to all legal knight moves, including L-shaped jumps.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players take turns moving their knights, with the game automatically switching between players after each move.
- **Win Conditions**: The game ends when one player has no legal moves remaining, and the opposing player is declared the winner.
